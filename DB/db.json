graphic, global designs of the Gibraltar area rug are reminiscent of roads less travelled. A bold oriental pattern is depicted in Spanish and Moroccan-influenced shades of rich red and navy. A truly nomadic design, this delightfully traditional rug is full of rustic warmth and character—and with its plush-pile, it’s full of comfort and texture, too. Beautiful, intricate borders frame a symmetrical floral pattern. Laid out in a southwestern style living room or dining room against leather seats and rich wood tones, the Gibraltar looks relaxed and welcoming with a classic rectangle cut. Hand-tufted in India using 100% natural wool fibers, the finish of the Gibraltar rug reflects the rugged sensibilities of a nomadic design, looking and feeling beautiful for years to come.","availability":{"wrgibraltar-s:23x8runner/c:red":{"isActive":true,"isInStock":false,"isBackOrderAllowed":false,"backOrderMessage":""},"wrgibraltar-s:36x56/c:red":{"isActive":true,"isInStock":false,"isBackOrderAllowed":false,"backOrderMessage":""}},"attributes":{"construction":["hand tufted"],"prices":["from0to100","from301to700","from101to300","from701"],"backing":["Cotton with Latex"],"ship_method":["Small Parcel"],"pattern":["Oriental"],"life_style":["High Traffic"],"style":["traditional & oriental"],"style_detailed":["Traditional"],"care":["We recommend vacuuming using a suction only attachment.
